Initial attempt at making an iOS application.

Nothing serious, just trying out MVVM in swift, understanding functional programming. 

Preparation for another swift application. :) 

## Ideas and help from Stanford iOS course and Sean Allen

### Some issues

- Curretly no Home Screen 
- Does not work in darkmode
- Does not support computer mode
